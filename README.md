- Python: For backend
- HTML and CSS: For frontend

## ☁️ Use of Linode

We have a dedicated Linode server for our backend. We use it for hosting our website and for storing our data. Linode Block Storage allows users to extend their server storage capacity with volumes on demand. Linode Backup allows us to back up their servers on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis which makes it easy and efficient. Linode allows users to manage multiple server instances across a single system.

## 🤝 Most Creative Use of GitHub

We are using GitHub for **Collaboration**. GitHub makes it easy to share code with others and helps a lot in collaboration. GitHub makes it easy to set up a project and get started. GitHub makes it easy to implement the **CI/CD workflow** and makes the deployment process easy. Deploying the project on GitHub helped us to get the project deployed on the network to be accessed by other people.
